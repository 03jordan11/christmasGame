["Welcome to Santa's workshop. We only have five days left until christmas so we need to get to work on wrapping these presents! ",
"Soon, all sorts of different toys are going to come down these conveyor belts. It's your job to make sure all these presents get wrapped!",
"To wrap a present, navigate to its conveyor by pressing w/s. When you're at the right conveyor press a/d to move along it. Once you get to a present tap space repeatedly until you finish wrapping the present!",
"Remember, Santa is counting on you. Try to make sure no presents fall off the end of the conveyor, if more than 5 kids lose their toys Santa might find a new elf to do the job!"],
["Great work yesterday, but keep on your toes, only 4 more days left till Christmas!",
"Great news! We were able to fix the coco machine, so now you can enjoy a warm cup of hot chocolate while you work!",
"To have a cup, wait for the coco machine to finish brewing, you can tell by the steam rising off the machine. Once it's ready, press x to take a break and have a cup.",
"Not only is it delicious, but having a cup will increase the speed at which you wrap presents. Best of luck today!"],
["Christmas is getting closer and closer each day, so we’ve decided to install something that will help you wrap more efficiently.",
"Now, each conveyor belt will have a lever that you can pull to stop the belt in case you get overloaded! To pull the lever, just walk up to it and press e",
"But be careful, the conveyor won’t stay stopped for long. Not only that, but if you pull more than 2 you will reset the ones you already pulled."],
["Two days left, Santa is counting on you! Remember everything he’s taught you. If you’ve forgotten anything, you can pause the game and click how to play"],
["Today is the last day, so presents are going to be coming in fast! Get ready and good luck!"]
