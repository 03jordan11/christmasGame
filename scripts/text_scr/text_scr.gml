"Soon, all sorts of different toys are going to come down these conveyor belts. It's your job to make sure all these presents get wrapped!",

"For help with controls go to the pause menu by pressing esc or start and select How To Play",
"Remember, Santa is counting on you. Try to make sure no presents fall off the end of the conveyor, if more than 5 kids lose their toys Santa might find a new elf to do the job!"],

["Great work yesterday, but keep on your toes, only 4 more days till Christmas!",
